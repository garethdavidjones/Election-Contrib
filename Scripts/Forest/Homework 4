Question 1:

    The the total width of the plot would need to 8 inches. In this example, the 4 diagonals have the same slope. 
    By calculating the base of the triangle given that the angle should be 45 degrees and the total height is 2 we see
    that the distance between the left vertex and the center needs to 2. Given that there are 4 diagonals we need to 
    multiply the total the base distance by 2 to get the total width of the chart.

            - Height = 2
            - tan(45) = 2/b
            - width = 4 * b

Question 2:
    
  function histo(x,q) {
  
     var n = x.length;
     var h = new Array(q);
     var minMax = minmax(x);

     // Initialize count in the new histogram
     for (var i = 0; i < q; i++) {
        h[i] = 0;
     }
     // Map element to buckets
     for (var i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        var binNum = bin(x[i], q, minMax);
        // Handle the boundary
        binNum = binNum == q ? q-1 : binNum;
        // Increment Bucket Count
        h[binNum]++
     }

     return h;
   }

Question 3:

    1000/B must be an integer otherwise the counts in the new histogram may be inaccurate because we don't know how the data was distributed in the original buckets

    
Question 4:
    A) The Mii element is the variance of the corresponding variable. Variance is strictly positive because it is the sum of the squared distance between the points and the mean. The squared component is the reason it is positive else the sum would be equal to 0.
    B) The first eigenvalue will correspond to the eigenvector in the d direction. The other eigenvalues will be small and do little to increase the variance of the data since e is very small.
    C) PCA will not allow us to learn anything new because none of the p variables are redundant. The ordering is determined by the variance of the variables.
