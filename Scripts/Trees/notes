Test: 3976917

Combinded: 1705832

Portion of Train in Test: 0.1367


Setup Two-Decision Trees:
    
    First Tree:
        People Whose Backgrounds We Know:
            Testing Dataset:
                * Dataset Includes all people in 2012 who have a past
                * We have to add all people who have a past as non-givers
            Only 0.1367 of them donated in 2012

    Second Tree:
        Peoples Backgrounds We Don't know
            We Train Based On All Previous Individuals Based on Characteristics
                * Exclude 2012
                * Exclude Some People Who
                * Only People Who Donated in General Elections
                * Things We Can Know Without Knowing Who They Donated Too
                    - i.e. we pretend that these are random individuals in the US


    train_individuals = train_data.map(lambda x: (x[5], "")).reduceByKey(add)
    test_individuals = test_data.map(lambda x: (x[5], "")).reduceByKey(add)
    print train_individuals.first()
    print test_individuals.first()

    train_count = train_individuals.count()
    test_count = test_individuals.count()
    print train_count
    print test_count
    print ""
    full_count = train_count + test_count
    comb_count = train_individuals.join(test_individuals).count()
    print comb_count
    print ""
    portion = comb_count / full_count
